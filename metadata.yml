  This book is not a usual programming tutorial. It's a series of dialogues between
  father and son where they work on a simple project. Step by step they add more features
  to the project, learning new programming concepts on the way.

  I hope this book will inspire children and their parents to take first steps in programming
  by using simple, but still very useful projects.
