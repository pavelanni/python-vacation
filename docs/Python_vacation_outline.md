Quick and dirty draft:

1. Beginning of the story: Frappuccino for friends
2. Pure Python: text menu, functions
3. How to save the orders. Text file, CSV file
4. List the orders
5. Will it work on my iPad?
6. Let's move on the Web! Simple HTML Forms and CGI basics. Apache directories
7. Create the form
8. Create the script to take orders
9. Script to list orders
10. Home page, workflow
11. Let's make it beautiful: Bootstrap
12. Like grownups: databases
13. Containers

Idea: Make the book personal: I use my son's name in the book, but you can customize it and replace it with your child's name. "Look, it's a book about you!". I think this will make her or him more willing to take this adventure.
