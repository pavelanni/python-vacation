# Python Vacation

Have you tried to teach your child programming basics? Have you succeeded? For me, it was always a struggle. Of course, I spoke with my son, explaining to him how important it is to have a basic understanding of programming. No doubt, he agreed with me. I even convinced him to take an online programming course. But still, something was missing. He didn't enjoy doing it. For him, it was just another flavor of school---something you _have_ to do to please your parents. I was looking for something to spark his interest, to get him eager to learn more.

Then it by accident. My son wanted to treat his friends with several cups of coffee of various flavors. He had to collect their orders: which flavor, which topping. I tried to use this opportunity to start a simple programming project with my son and... he got hooked!  

 We started with a simple Python application to take orders with text-based menus. Then we learned how to use files to store the orders. Then we moved to its web-based version, then added styling, then connected it to a database... We had a lot of programming adventures during summer vacation. 

 I have collected our dialogs and pieces of Python code in this book as they happened, almost with no changes. This book is still a work in progress, as is our Python education. We will continue working with this simple application to publish it online (first on virtual hosting, then on the cloud). We will explore different tools to automate its deployment (I started with a simple Ansible example and am going to try other frameworks). We are going to containerize it. We are going to use a NoSQL database too. With an application as simple as ours, you can play with all kinds of modern technologies. And if you can explain them to your child, that means you understand them yourself. 

 You can use this book as a gentle step-by-step introduction to Python programming. I hope our dialogs will spark some project ideas you could try with your child. I'd be glad to hear your feedback and your stories about teaching your children programming. Please use the Comments section in each chapter. Connect with me via LinkedIn (use the logo at the bottom of the page). You can also send me an email: pavel -dot- anni -at- gmail -dot- com.

My plan is to publish this as a real book (electronic book for sure, maybe even as a paper book). Please let me know if you are going to buy it, and I will ping you when the book is ready.

Enjoy!
