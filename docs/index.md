# Python Vacation

This book is written as a series of simple programming exercises which we did with my son during summer vacation. I found out that despite the fact that he has completed one of the online Python courses, he still needed some simple practical projects to use his skills. So we started with simple ordering application with text-based menus, moved to its web-based version, added some styling, then connected it to a database... In other words, a lot of programming adventures during summer vacation.
