# Python Vacation --- Day 7

## Web Interface

It's been a couple of days since our last lesson with Erik. He was visibly excited about his application. He showed it to Mom, to Grandma, he took orders from them, he changed his welcome message several times. Now the message shouted: `WELCOME *** TO ERIK'S BEST COFFEESHOP *** WELCOME`.

I've been pondering about the best way to start moving toward web application. On one hand, there are plenty of Python-based web frameworks: Flask, Bottle, Django, Pyramid, and others. Of course, for any serious application we would take one of them. But I was going to explain to Erik the basic mechanics of a web application which is usually hidden in such frameworks. So I decided to start with more traditional approach: Apache web server and CGI scripts.

"Are you ready to migrate your application to the web?" I asked Erik after lunch.

"Yes, I really want it. I'd like to show it to my neighborhood friends on my iPad!"

"Okay," I said. "But be prepared, we have to learn a couple of important things on the way. "
